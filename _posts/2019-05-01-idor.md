## What is IDOR
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability attackers can bypass authorization and access resources in the system directly, for example database records or files.

## Discovery

Our University had 2019 Odd sems exams.
The next month we got our results on the university's portal as 

```
results.[redacted].ac.in/2019/odd/[roll no.]
```


It always has sparked a curiosity in me wherever I see an integer in the URL to tamper it with random data and so did I.
I Simply incremented the Roll No. like:


```
results.[redacted].ac.in/2019/odd/1600227425 -> ...426
```

and you can guess what happened next, I got the result of another student.

## Impact
The Confidentiality in CIA triad was Violated.
I was able to access other Students' exam results which also included their Personal Details like Father's Name, Contact Number and Address.

This means anyone can extract personally identifiable information for any other student with only a single student login and a simple automated integer incrementor.

## Reporting
Reported it to the IT Cell of the university like any other responsible hunter would do.

They fixed it immediately.
