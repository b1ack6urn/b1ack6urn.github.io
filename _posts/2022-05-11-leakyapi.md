### Introduction
The Web Application was an Exam Portal where the faculties can create/schedule Online Exams, invite and assign tests to the students. Students can then login and give their respective exams.

### Burp, My old friend
- I setup the Burp Proxy to intercept all my requests to the Portal.
- Started with the Dynamic Analysis of the application, the flows and how I can try to tamper with the its Logic.
- On these scenarios the OWASP TESTING GUIDE is helpful to have a checklist by your side.
- Tested several Checks, Input validation, Fuzzing, but found Nothing interesting.
- Giving the application a pause I went to look for anything interesting in Burp.
- I started playing with the HTTP Request Header in an attempt to break the logic.
- First thing I did was to observe all the status code and the HTTP Response they gave back.
- Nothing Interesting there either.
- Futher tampering with the Headers I played with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- I noticed that changing few chars in the token **did not** cause any difference in reponse, but instead i got all the results like I got from the authentic token.
- I removed the whole header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and guess what, I still got same results.

- The API was leaking CRITICAL severity data to unauthenticated Users.
- I went on a hunt to find what other APIs are affected. 
- Found that there were total 6 APIs leaking data, one of which is the Users API as mentioned in above screenshot, which leaked PII of all the ~1000 users on that platform viz 
  - Names
  - Email IDs
  - Phone Number
  - Addressf
  - UserID (Refer to [this]({% post_url 2022-05-12-awscognito %}) article on how I did Super Admin Privilege Escalation using this)

### Impact
##### 1. Sensitive Data Exposure
  - Exposure of sensitive personal data can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual for malicious intents.

##### 2. Financial Loss
  - Costs can include compensating affected customers, setting up incident response efforts, investigating the breach, investment into new security measures, legal fees, regulatory penalties that can be imposed for non-compliance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). 

##### 3. Reputational Damage
  - Once the Integrity of an Organisation is compromised the Users begin to see them as untrusted or unsecured, even when exposures are patched, making them more hesitant to provide them with personal information.

### Remediation
  - Token Validation at Server end should be set in place before sending back any data to the Client.
