The scope of engagement will be called as example.com and api-server.com to respect the NDA.

## Here's a summary of Findings
- Google dork to find subdomains of Target.
- Found student.example.com, registered my user there.
- Intercepting the login API calls, found the API Server (api-server.com).
- Server page returned no data other than `Â© 2023 - My ASP.NET Web Secure API`
- A quick directory fuzzing gave me a `/help` directory which is an API Documentation Page.
- POST getUserDetails() API caught my eye, clicking the API, it took me to its details Page.
- The details page was totally blank. Checked the Request, the Server did respond with `text/html` type but data not being displayed in Browser.
- Invoking my Web App Development skills, I inspected the Page, found a global CSS property set to `display:none` to mask all the contents.
- Override `display:block` which gave me the contents of Page, aka, API documentation for getUserDetails().
- Request body included `user-id` integer and a `Authorization: Bearer` header.
- Got my Login token from the student.example.com which I registered.
- Did a following curl request
```bash
curl -i -X POST 'https://api-server.com/getUserDetails' -h 'Authorization: Bearer <Token>' -h 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"user-id":"<myuserid>"}'
```
- Server returned my user details.
- Manipulated the user-id field, Server returned that user's data too. (IDOR screaming in background)
- Manually ping-ed the server to find the start and end user-id's.
- Total Count included 33,000+ Users.
- User data included Name, DOB, EmailID, Address, Guardian Details, Government Docs Link, to name a few.

## Bonus section
- API Documentation also had one updateUserDetails() API,
- Vulnerable to using an Authorization Token along with any user-id.
- Allowing me to tamper other User's details in a flick.

Reported these flaws responsibly like any other Security Researcher should do.
