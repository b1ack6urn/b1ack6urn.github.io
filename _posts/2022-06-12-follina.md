Let me explain.
Our fellow user became a victim of the Latest MS Office Attack (CVE 2022-30190) aka Follina.

"Whats a big deal running a Calculator app?"

The attacker setup the exploit to run Calc.exe

He could've also:
- Sent your sensitive files to his machine.
- Setting up the backdoor.
- Running any Powershell command with the user's privileges, etc

"What Can I do to prevent this"
