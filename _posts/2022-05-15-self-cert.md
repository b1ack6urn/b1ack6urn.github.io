## in Server 
##### Prerequisites: nginx running with `curl localhost`
- Generate Public and Private Cert using:

  `sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt`
- Generate dhparam pem (Diffie-Hellman key exchange prime number) (takes few mins)

  `sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096`
- vim /etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
```yml
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
```

- vim /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
```yml
ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem; 
ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM;
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_session_timeout  10m;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_session_tickets off;
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
resolver_timeout 5s;
# Disable strict transport security for now. You can uncomment the following
# line if you understand the implications.
#add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload";
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
```
- vim /etc/nginx/your_config_file.conf
```yml
#inside server block
        server_name <your_domain_name, use localhost, _ for testing>;
        include snippets/self-signed.conf;
        include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

        listen 443 ssl default_server;
        listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
```
- Test for any conf error or failures

```bash
# check if ufw firewall is ENABLED via >sudo ufw status, else skip
# sudo ufw allow ssh #to allow ssh into vm
# sudo ufw allow 'nginx full'
# sudo ufw allow https
# sudo ufw reload

# this will check for any syntax errors in nginx conf
sudo nginx -t

# if tests are success
sudo systemctl restart nginx
curl -ki https://your_domain_name or localhost
```

### in Client 
- Copy (eg. SCP) Self-Signed Certificate from Server's `/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt` to Clients'  `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/nginx-selfsigned.crt`
- Run
```bash
update-ca-certificates
#should return
#1 added, 0 removed; done.
```
- Test
```bash
curl -i https://your_domain_name
```

### End Notes
Although there are sometimes need to use Self-Signed SSL Certificates in an internal app it is recommended to use Trusted CA Signed SSL Certificates wherever possible.
